            "abstract" : "Serverless not only reduces time spent managing infrastructure, but it can also reduce application code. Replacing custom code with fully managed cloud services makes applications more reliable and easier to maintain. Serverless integration services like AWS Step Functions, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS enable you to evolve your application as business requirements change and service features advance. This talk walks through examples of evolving your serverless architectures. These include real world examples of how the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) uses serverless to build workflows with AI/ML and human review steps and to integrate with hybrid environments"
