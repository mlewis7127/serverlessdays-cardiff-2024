Learn about event-driven architectures and how to use services such as AWS Step Functions and Amazon EventBridge and more. This workshop shows how to combine workflows with events to create powerful architectures that can support production workloads. By the end, youâ€™ll have built a scalable serverless web application that allows your users to order coffee, and allows baristas to keep track of and fulfil orders.
